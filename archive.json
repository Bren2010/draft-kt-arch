I think text about how a new log could potentially take over from an old one with the help of auditors of the old log or something like that might do the trick though. I guess that'd be a form of portability? Or maybe as you say, if common practice was for end users to not only use one log but to commonly make use of >1 independent logs, then maybe that'd be enough. I do think covering such issues in an architecture document would be needed or it'd never be covered later though.",
