                     Key Transparency Architecture
              draft-mcmillion-keytrans-architecture-latest

Abstract

   This document defines the terminology and interaction patterns
   involved in the deployment of Key Transparency (KT) in a general
   secure group messaging infrastructure, and specifies the security
   properties that the protocol provides.  It also gives more general,
   non-prescriptive guidance on how to securely apply KT to a number of
   common applications.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   *End-to-end Encrypted Communication Service:*  A communications
      service that allows end-users to engage in text, voice, video, or
      other forms of communication over the Internet, that uses public
      key cryptography to ensure that communications are only accessible
      to their intended recipients.

   *End-user Device:*  The device at the final point in a digital
      communication, which may either send or receive encrypted data in
      an end-to-end encrypted communication service.

   *End-user Identity:*  A unique and user-visible identity associated
      with an account (and therefore, one or more end-user devices) in
      an end-to-end encrypted communication service.  In the case where
      an end-user explicitly requests to communicate with (or is
      informed they are communicating with) an end-user uniquely
      identified by the name "Alice", the end-user identity is the
      string "Alice".

   *Service Provider:*  The primary organization that provides the
      infrastructure and software resources necessary to operate an end-
      to-end encrypted communication service.

   *Authentication Service:*  A specialized service capable of securely
      attesting to the information (such as public keys) associated with
      a given end-user identity.  The authentication service is run
      either entirely or partially by the Service Provider.
